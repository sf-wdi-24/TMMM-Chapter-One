1. What does the quote on the first page mean to you?

As a ship has successfully made its way to the beach is a role model to the other ships, a successful project is a role model to other projects which struggle to succeed.

Products are becoming obsolete upon completion


How much time does the last bug take to fix?
I didn't understand the question. It mentioned that It takes more time to find the last difficult bugs than the first. I assume that the last bugs takes less time to fix since it's the last bug and there are no other bugs connected to it and the rest of the system works properly.
