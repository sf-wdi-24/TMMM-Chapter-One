 **_"A ship on the beach is a lighthouse to the sea."_**

To me, this Dutch proverb means that you can learn from another's mistake.  Or even from your own.  Just as a lighthouse warns those at sea of the rocky shore, so too does a grounded ship.  As a developer, we can make mistakes, debug them, and then learn not to make the same mistakes again.

Not every ship will make it's voyage unscathed.  Similarly, not every software project will succeed.  Many projects may fail to meet deadlines because they were too ambitious.  They may take too much time to complete and become obsolete before they are finished.  Other reasons which projects may not succeed include a lack of resources (funding, personnel, technology), conflicts or poor communication within a team, or ideas being discarded for various reasons.

First off, it is exciting making new things.  There is a creative aspect to programming that can be very exciting.  It is also challenging and very much like solving puzzles.  Many people find that working on a team to solve real-world problems can be invigorating.

Programming is not always fun though.  There are several aspects which can be frustrating.  Code needs to be perfect in order for it to run.  If you cannot send directions to the computer in a way that the computer can understand it, then it will throw error messages.  Debugging programs can be both time consuming and infuriating at times.  Often simple bugs in your program are easy to fix but may lead to more bugs.  The last bug is often much harder to see than the first ones, meaning that it takes much longer to fix.
