1) What does the quote on the first page mean to you?
"A ship on the beach is a lighthouse to the sea." I think this proverb means that a mistake is not a failure, it is actually a lession for eveyone and for yourself. That mistake will guide you to success and help others to avoid the same mistake that you have made. 

2) Does every software project succeed?
Absolutely not. Human-beeings are not perfect and they ALWAYS make mistakes. I can assume that they could create a perfect software project today but tomorrow there could be a bug that turn success into a failure. Sometimes, programmers don't even know that their project does not pass all possible tests because they think if it passes all the tests they could think of, it is a success. 

3) What are some reasons why a project may fail to meet deadlines?
Technology is always advancing and I could say it's changing in every second. A project may be a success today but tomorrow it could become failure like the text mentions that as soon as one freezes a design, it become an obsolete.
Finding the last bug always take more time than the first one. I think even though the last bug is found before the deadline, sonner or later there will be another bug as developers could not always see it until users use their product and report the bug.

4) What is fun about programming?
Like the text say it is "the sheer of making things". With technical skills, programmers can build anything within their ability and they will be happy if other people enjoy using their products. I personally think the fun part is that sometimes I'm stuck in a problem and it bothers me for hours or days but when I can solve it, it only take less than a minute do the coding. The fun part is that you are happy when you complete something.

5) What is not fun about programming?
I would be the debugging part because humans made mistake all the time and sometimes they do not know where the mistake is and when they make that mistake. For me, sometimes I try to find ONE bug, I end it up making more bugs. The best solution for this situation is to take a break, leave it and come back later.

6) How much time does the last bug take to fix?
I would say the last bug is usually take the most time to fix as thing is getting more complicated toward the end. For a small or simple project I would believe in LAST BUG, but for a large project LAST BUG does not exist because there are always bugs in the program. The problem is how soon we can find the bug and how soon we can debug it.
