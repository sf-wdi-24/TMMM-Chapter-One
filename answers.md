HOMEWORK ANSWERS

1. What does the quote on the first page mean to you?
	"A ship on the beach is a lighthouse to the sea"
	To me, this means that a mistake is always potentially a good thing because we learn from them. By being able to identify and understand our mistakes and why we make them, we can and will grow as developers and or people in general.

2. Does every software project succeed?
	Absolutely not. As the text says, even if a software reaches completion, many times, the technology created proves itself to be obsolete. 

3. What are some reasons why a project may fail to meet deadlines?
	Some developers may not work well together and therefore find it hard to make progress in development. The allocated time to complete the project may be unrealistic. Certain issues or problems may arise during development that weren't anticipated.

4. What is fun about programming?
	So many things! The text compares many aspects of development to a child like wonder and hunger. As a developer, we find it fun to create nothing out of something like a child's "mudpies." We (developers) also find it fun to create things for others utility like a child creating a "clay" vase for dad to hold his pencils in at work. It's fun to tinker! For example, it's fun to consider a complex program as a whole and break it down into it's functioning parts, much like a physical machine. So many things!

5. What is not fun about programming?
 So many things! Not really. :) I choose to believe (perhaps naively?) that the good and fun things about programming tend to outweigh the bad in most situations. Some examples of why programming can be a pain are:
 	Programming provides no room for mistake. All of our code must be entered in perfectly and it must interact with with every bit of our other code perfectly or our expected result will never be. Debugging is WORK. Going through each and every bit of code to figure out why it doesn't work isn't appealing to the majority. As mentioned in a previous question, how quickly technology evolves and changes dictates whether or not your project will succeed sometimes even before it is completed. This reality can become daunting.

6. How much time does the last bug take to fix?
	There is no 'last' bug. There are just bugs. Software is constantly in flux even after release. This is especially true when implementing and using it with other software. I feel the idea of "the flawless program" is unique to the user and therefore so is the idea of the "last bug."



I liked this quote:
"The real tiger is never a match for the paper one"
The idea always holds more weight than the product?
