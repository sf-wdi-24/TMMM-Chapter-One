1. What does the quote on the first page mean to you?
 - I understand this quote to mean that seeing the mistakes of others is a good reminder for the rest to be cautious.  This also shows that people will make mistakes

2. Does every software project succeed?
 - No, definitely not.  Project’s will not succeed for many different reasons, even completion of a project can still mean it’s riddled with bugs.

3. What are some reasons why a project may fail to meet deadlines?
 - Projects can fail because of a misunderstanding that more manpower can be a substitute for time.  Timelines could be set well before the projects begins and the never get revisited once programming begins.  They can also fall behind because it’s hard to determine exactly how long something will take.  You cannot accurately gauge how long each component will take to code.

4. What is fun about programming?
 - The part about programming that I think is the most fun is when working on a challenge and works the way you want it to, whether it took 3 hours or 3 minutes.  I am genuinely surprised and pleased when I write some code and it just works the first time.  I’m really hoping this doesn’t go away.  The other main thing I enjoy is the immediate feedback that programming can provide.  You run your code and can get a good idea of whether or not it works.

5. What is not fun about programming?
 - The not so fun aspect of programming is the frustration of looking at something I wrote and not being able to see why its not working, whether it be an error that totally breaks everything or not coming out with the right output.  I’m hoping that this will get a little easier over time.

6. How much time does the last bug take to fix?
 - ∞.  As technologies grow, change, become more complex something that was written to work on one platform is not guaranteed to work on the next platform.  The emergence of smart phones and tablets over the past few years will only amplify this because the sheer number of viewing devices is larger than ever before.
