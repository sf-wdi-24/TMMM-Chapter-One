What does the quote on the first page mean to you?

"A ship on the beach is a lighthouse to the sea."

To me, this means that the mistakes of previous sailors are warnings all sailors.  We can learn from others mistakes.  Their failures are warnings to us.   And we can learn from others even if they have failed in their ventures. 


Does every software project succeed?

Ha ha!

Also, some software is BETTER than the competitors but still fails due to other reasons like marketing or funding or traction or timing. 


What are some reasons why a project may fail to meet deadlines?

Scope creep!  

Complexity.  Too ambitious.  Poorly estimated. 

Too many chefs in the kitchen. 

And the added complication of communication, and the need to train new people. 



What is fun about programming?

The job of building something from nothing.  Like God, creating our own world. 

And of watching others use what we created. 

And of always learning. 



What is not fun about programming?

Testing and bug fixing!

Building something you didn't think of or something you don't believe in. 



How much time does the last bug take to fix?

Ha ha!  90% of the time. 

NOTE:  All products ship with bugs.  The product manager needs to decide how much EXPOSURE the existing bugs have to the audience.   There is no such thing as bug free software.
