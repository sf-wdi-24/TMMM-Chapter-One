1. To me this quote means that if you are struggling on a certain problem or path to remember that there has always been someone who has struggled with the same issue. That someone has been able to do it before, and you need to be resourceful in trying to find the solutions because more often times than not it is out there.
2. Not every project succeeds. There are many nuances when trying to implement a program to be interactive with other programs. There is a lot of struggle and failure.
3. There are unreasonable deadlines and to solve this issue many times companies will add more manpower. However this just requires more 'gasoline for the fire' which can be counterproductive. Many times the project is not sufficiently planned for the time it is needed te be produced.
4. Programming is fun because it gives you the ability to use creativity and actually build things people can use. As a programmer you want your programs to be used by other people, and although it can be stressful and filled with setbacks the reward most definitely outweights the struggle.
5. When your trying to incorporate a program into a larger piece there are many peices that it needs to interlock with to run smoothly. This can be timely and use a lot fo resources. Many times once your program is done there are new technologies being introduced making your idea obsolete.
6. More time than the rookie thinks.
