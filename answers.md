1.	What does the quote on the first page mean to you?

“A ship on the beach is a lighthouse to the sea.”

What this means to me is that a failure for one person is actually a great lesson for everyone else, to learn from that person’s mistakes.


2.	Does every software project succeed?  

No, not every project succeeds. 


3.	What are some reasons why a project may fail to meet deadlines?

It may take longer than expected due to bugs, not correctly estimating how long it will take to complete a project, not having the right direction, amount of time, skills, or budget.

4.	What is fun about programming?

Creating things for useful to ourselves and others, and the problem-solving involved (at least, once the problems are solved, it’s fun!) Also, learning new things.

5.	What is not fun about programming?

Being human and making errors, causing the program not to work. Relying on other people or their programs, which also contain errors. Debugging is tedious, especially as projects grow in scale. 

Something I haven’t experienced yet in programming that the book mentions- working hard but having the project become obsolete before completion.

6.	How much time does the last bug take to fix? 

Longer than it takes to find the first bug.
