No way. You could complete it but the technology becomes obsolete by that time.


3. What are some reasons why a project may fail to meet deadlines?

Unrealistic timelines for the amount of work needed to be done, team members not agreeing with each other, the universe decides to give you and your team a big middle finger on deadline day and breaks the project.


4. What is fun about programming?

Building something from scratch and making it run is exciting..also that feeling when finding the one typo making your whole app break.

Thinking I found the problem causing the error and applying the "fix" actually makes the whole thing break is pretty frustrating.  

6. How much time does the last bug take to fix?

Unless you're the ultimate developer, I don't think there will ever be a last bug. Someone will probably find something wrong with the app.
